 
 Lab title: Google cloud Fundamentals: Getting Starte with GKE

 
Lab Objective:

# In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

1) Provision a Kubernetes cluster using Kubernetes Engine.

2) Deploy and manage Docker containers using kubectl.


	Steps
# Login to google cloud console

# Scroll down in the list of enabled APIs, and confirm that both of these APIs are enabled:
	**Kubernetes Engine API
	**Container Registry API

if they are not listed, you should enable it by clicking Enable APIs and Services at the top.



		Task one:

1) Provision a Kubernetes cluster using Kubernetes Engine.


#open cloud shell...
	using the assigned zone, provided by qwiklab.
 #export MY_ZONE=us-central1-a

Start a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubernetes Engine.
	#gcloud container clusters create webfrontend --zone $MY_ZONE --num-nodes 2 (this is configured to run only two labs)

check your installed version of Kubernetes(checks for installed version)
	#kubectl version


		Task two:
2) Deploy and manage Docker containers using kubectl.

launch a single instance of the nginx
	#kubectl create deploy nginx --image=nginx:1.17.10

View the pod running the nginx container:
	#kubectl get pods


Expose the nginx container to the Internet:
#kubectl expose deployment nginx --port 80 --type LoadBalancers

View the new service:
#kubectl get services

use the display External Ip address to test
rerun: kubectl get services

Scale up the number of pods running on your service:
#kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas 3

Confirm that Kubernetes has updated the number of pods:
# kubectl get pods

Confirm that your external IP address has not changed:
#kubectl get services

Return to the web browser tab in which you viewed your cluster's external IP address.
Refresh the page to confirm that the nginx web server is still responding.
