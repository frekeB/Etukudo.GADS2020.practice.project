 
 Lab title: Google cloud Fundamentals: Getting Starte with compute Engine


 Lab Objective:

# In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:

1) Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.

2) Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.

3) Connect between the two instances.

##Steps:

 To start login to google console using your credential using:
 
 gcloud auth login [ACCOUNT] [--no-activate] [--brief] [--enable-gdrive-access] [--force] [--no-launch-browser] [--update-adc] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG …]


	#Task one:

1) Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.

# List the available compute zones using: 

 gcloud compute zones list | grep us-central1
 
 gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-1" --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" --subnet "default" tags http.
 
create a firewall rule:

# allow SSH, RDP and ICMP for the given network
gcloud compute firewall-rules create managementnet-allow-icmp-ssh-rdp --direction=INGRESS --priority=1000 --network=managementnet --action=ALLOW --rules=tcp:22,3389,icmp --source-ranges=0.0.0.0/0
# allow internal from given source range
	

	#Task Two:

2) Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.

	gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-b
	
	gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-2" \
	--machine-type "n1-standard-1" \
	--image-project "debian-cloud" \
	--image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" \
	--subnet "default"


	Task Three:

3) Connect between the two instances.

To open a command prompt on the my-vm-2 instance, click SSH in its row in the VM instances list.

Use the ping command to confirm that my-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1 over the network:

#ping my-vm-1
#Ctrl+C
#ssh my-vm-1

If you are prompted about whether you want to continue connecting to a host with unknown authenticity, enter yes to confirm that you do.

#sudo apt-get install nginx-light -y
 (  At the command prompt on my-vm-1)

#sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html
below the H1 header, add a text like this:

Hi from YOUR_NAME (where YOUR_NAME is replaced with your name.)

press Ctrl+O and Press Enter key.
  Exit nano by pressing Ctrl+X 

curl http://localhost/ (to confirm the web server is serving your web page.
exit my-vm-1 by typing exit.

To confirm that my-vm-2 can reach the web server on my-vm-1,
 at the command prompt on my-vm-2, execute this command:
curl http://my-vm-1/
